In this semester, I took part in a class named Artificial Intelligence System Security.
However, The teacher seems not interested in this subject, so we can learn little from him.
As above, I read a book about AI in National Day to gain some basic concepts. **It's time to practice.**

So I found some resource and decieded to create this branch to record my learning process.
