>  你每一次直接把答案告诉他, 直接帮他们解决问题, 都是在剥夺他接受专业训练的机会. 相反, 如果你真的希望能帮助他, 你可以尝试在不影响他训练的情况下指出他缺少的观念和技能, 该查资料/看手册/看代码, 就让他去查资料/看手册/看代码, 引导他针对问题提出自己的思考, 然后尝试并总结解决方案. 这对你和他来说都不容易, 但学习本身就是一件需要付出的事情: 如果你让他很方便地获得问题的答案, 那他就不能从解决这个问题的过程中收获应有的训练.

Sharing this branch technically violates **academic integrity**, so why did I still do it? Here's why:

1. The mini-semester task was extremely unclear. The **"Microprocessor System Design" course** involves **ysyx, Nanjing University's PA, and RISC-V CPU design**, creating a complex mix of three intertwined projects. Figuring out the way forward was extremely challenging.
2. The available lab instructions were only descriptive of phenomena, without explaining the reasoning behind them. While following the guide, I couldn't understand "Why am I doing this? What is the overall framework and direction?" Additionally, the lab instructions were outdated and not very applicable.
3. As a student from another university (not NJU), the guidance from the instructor during the lab was very limited. Furthermore, I was the only one in my class who chose "Microprocessor System Design" for the mini-semester project, so there was no one to discuss the course with. (On top of that, most of my peers in the mini-semester were unmotivated and just trying to get by without investing effort.)

I sincerely hope that these two files, `report.pdf` and `ics2024.tar.gz`, can help guide future students in this course, so that they won't waste too much time figuring things out unnecessarily. It's important to note that I spent about 2/5 of the mini-semester fixing my computer's software and hardware, so I only managed to complete a small portion of the work. However, even within the remaining 3/5 of the time, I truly learned a lot of concepts and grew as a student, such as **"RTFM, STFW, RTFSC"** and others.

I hope that future students can genuinely gain something from the mini-semester, rather than drifting through it and wasting valuable time.
