In this semester, I took part in a class named Artificial Intelligence System Security.
However, The teacher seems not interested in this subject, so we can learn little from him.
As above, I read a book about AI in National Day to gain some basic concepts. **It's time to practice.**

So I found some resource and decieded to create this branch to record my learning process.

Reference are listed below:
1. [Introduction to this course](https://csdiy.wiki/%E4%BA%BA%E5%B7%A5%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD/CS188/)
2. [Course site](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa22/)

Due to my own laziness and inability, I decided to give up studying cs188, but I still keep this branch. I hope some links here can help others later.

By the way, I also studied **cs144**. The originally closed Stanford cs144 course website https://cs144.github.io/ has been **reopened**! Interested friends can learn by themselves.
If you want to learn the **2021 fall** course, you can use the `git log` to find the github repository where cs144 has been completed, and complete the cs144 course design through `git checkout` backtracking. Here are some reference links:
